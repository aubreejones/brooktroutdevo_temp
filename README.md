Data and files relating to experiment in collaboration with USGS to examine development of the lateral line in brook trout under different temperature regimes relevant to climate change. 

Spreadsheets and Code documents are in attached files. See descriptions below: 

Spreadsheets: 
Sf_NMCounts_DiASP_USGSTempStudy = Neuromast Count data derived from vital staining with 4-Di-2-ASP
Sf_SEMMeasurements_forR = Neuromast size data, measurements from SEM images 
TempData = daily temperatures (measured 8 times per day) of tank temperatures in husbandry rearing system 

Code: 
Sf_Temp_R_SEM_NeuromastSize.Rmd = R markdown file containing code for analysis of SEM neuromast size data, works with Sf_SEMMeasurements_forR spreadsheet 
Sf_Temp_TankTempData_USGS.Rmd = R markdown file containing code to produce graph for daily temperature log data 
Sf_Temp_NMCounts_DiASP.Rmd = R markdown file containing code for analysis of vital staining with 4-Di-2-ASp neuromast number data, works with Sf_NMCounts_DiASP_USGSTempStudy spreadsheet
